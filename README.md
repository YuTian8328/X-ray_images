# X-ray_images


Theoreically, computer-aided [patients triage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triage) system can perform a automatic initial interpretation of the periodontal condition of patients in a dental clinic. It can help to classify patients into different categories, severe periodontitis (more than 1/2 bone around the teeth root is lost, left image), moderate periodontits (1/3-1/2 bone is lost, middle image), mild periodontitis or healthy periodontal tissue (less than 1/3 bone is lost, right image). Based on this classification patients will be refered to an oral hygienist (mild periodontitis) or a general dentist (moderate periodontitis) or a specialist (severe periodotits).

# Problem Formulation: 
- It's a Multi-class classification problem
- One set of X-ray image is one observation
- Label is a categorical variable, 0 for mild or healty, 1 for moderate and 2 for severe
- Train a PCA(or NMF) + SVC model by applying Hinge loss function to measure the quality of SVC
- Or implement a Neural Network based on a pretrained model (transfer learning). Use cross entropy loss function as train.

# Method
- Images are collected from my prior work, for deep learning it's a small dataset, so image augmentation and transfer learning is necessary process
- K-fold cross validation will be applyed
  - Shuffle the dataset randomly
  - Split the dataset into k groups 
- manually analyze miss classified samples and modify evaluation metrics or loss function, as severe samples being classified as moderate or mild should be avoidedï¼Œotherwise moderate samples being classified as severe won't hurt that much
- Libraries: Tensorflow, keras, imageio, PIL, numpy, matplotlib...
